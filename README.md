FastSlam Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) Assignment - Robotics Elements Course
</h1>

<p align="center">
    This project is part of the Robotics Elements Course from the department of Mechatronics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP).
    It contains two sequential sub-projects: (1) an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation of a controller trycycle and (2) FastSlam, a Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) implementation built on top of the first assignment. The projects are located at the src directory, and were developed by me (Bruno) and Lucas Hattori.
